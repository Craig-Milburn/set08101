		<h2>Growing Up</h2>
		<p>I left school in 2010 as I had determined I could no longer happily spend time with the people I was surrouned by. I got a job working in a store. This allowed me the money to have my first expierience building a PC.</p>

		<p>This sparked an interest which I continuted as a hobby, little did I know how far my interest would take me.</p>
		<p>I applied to be a firefighter, and passed all the training but fell short when my mathematics was too slow. I applied to be a
		CNC
		and was turned away because my dyslexia would get in the way of my tasks.</p>
		<p>While waiting for the return of my application to the CNC I entered a new job working for 
		Survitec
		as a Technicians assistant. The job was tough going and increadibly physical, 60 hours a week. When the application failed I felt lost. I left the job I was in and began looking inward and decided that I needed to find something I enjoyed to do for the rest of my life. So at 23 years old searching for college courses on the 
		Edinburgh College website
		I found a level 6 course on Techincal Support. Having an interest in computing and previous expierience with being a techinicans assistant I applied.</p>
		<p>I passed the entry interview and was enrolled in the course.</p>
