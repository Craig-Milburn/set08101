<h2>Growing Up</h2>
<p>I left school in 2010 as I had determined I could no longer happily spend time with the people I was surrouned by. I got a job working in a store. This allowed me the money to have my first expierience building a PC.</p>

<p>This sparked an interest which I continuted as a hobby, little did I know how far my interest would take me.</p>
<p>I applied to be a firefighter, and passed all the training but fell short when my mathematics was too slow. I applied to be a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Nuclear_Constabulary">CNC</a>
and was turned away because my dyslexia would get in the way of my tasks.</p>
<p>While waiting for the return of my application to the CNC I entered a new job working for 
<a href="https://survitecgroup.com/">Survitec</a>
as a Technicians assistant. The job was tough going and increadibly physical, 60 hours a week. When the application failed I felt lost. I left the job I was in and began looking inward and decided that I needed to find something I enjoyed to do for the rest of my life. So at 23 years old searching for college courses on the 
<a href="http://www.edinburghcollege.ac.uk/">Edinburgh College website</a>
I found a level 6 course on Techincal Support. Having an interest in computing and previous expierience with being a techinicans assistant I applied.</p>
<p>I passed the entry interview and was enrolled in the course.</p>
