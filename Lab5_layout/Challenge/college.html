<h2>Level 6 - Technical Support</h2>
<p>Level 6 techinical support for the most part felt like I was spending time in a day care. I was learning valuable information but I didn't feel challenges in any means. Reports where created by pasting in a snapshot with little to no context to prove you had gotten to a certain stage. As part of the course we had to complete a module of Communications, the work I produced for the module was of a standard above that of the course. For this reason the lecturer offered that if I completed an assessment for the upper level she would be able to submit my work for the award. I was uncertain due to my dyslexia but proceeded and successfully achieved the higher level.</p>
<p>One of the enjoyable parts of the course was creating a 3D printer. When completed it I bought the printer from the college and took it home to as proof of what I could achieve. The course also allowed me to create a friends group with people equally interested in technology so that I could discuss the findings of the course.</p>
<p>Unbeknown to me the course followed on into a further qualification, HND Networking. The conditions for getting into the HND course were that you passed all modules of the Level 6 course. I had gone into the course thinking of getting a job giving technical support over the phone at the end or possibly building custom systems. Now I was considering getting a HND with very reasonable job prospects at the end of it.</p>
<p>I discussed the prospects with my partner who felt that if I was capable it wouldn't hurt to attempt to achieve a higher qualification so I applied for the 2 year HND course.</p>

<h2>HND - Networking</h2>
<p>I went into the HND not too sure how much work I would require to know and it was feeling very intents. It started of following on and building on the information we had already made in the Level 6 course. 
<aside>
<p>This actually reminds me of the content covered in the Level 6 was of a high quality yet my mind remembers it in a much more simplified manner.</p>
</aside>
<p>For the first year I wasn't sure I was cut out for the placement in this level of education and was tempted to apply for another level 6 course to prepare further for a HND placement. That was until I started to recieve the marks for the work I was handing in. I would A's every piece of work without fail. This continued to build my conidence in my ability. That was until the graded unit was around the corner. I began to panic that I wouldn't be able to perform on the day. I spoke with a lecturer to informed me that so long as I got a B I would be continuing to the next year and that he had not worry I would achieve that grade. I went into the exam, the next 4 hours passed without no time and I walked away feeling that I couldn't have done any better than I had and had answered every question to the best of my ability.</p>
<p>When the grades came out they wouldn't inform us our percentages but did tell us if it was a high or low grade. When I went out to recieve my grade the lecturer looked at me shocked and informed me that it was a high A, a very high A. That was me into year 2 of the HND. I was able to later in my academic career to get my actaul percentage, I had scored 95% on the graded unit.</p>
