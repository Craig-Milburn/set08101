		<h2>About</h2>
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci"><h3>Mind Palace</h3></a>
		<p>Mind Palaces have been called many different names depending on where you get your sources from. These names include, memory journey and memory palace however, the correct name is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci">Method of loci</a>. This method involves creating a structure inside your head where things can be placed to be recalled. These palaces are best put into practice by following the same path through the palace. The structure used is often somewhere that is well known to the subject. In this game the structure of the palace is pre-made, the path is not set however and is left up to the indvidual to create. The Method of loci has been used to remember relatively short combinations of items to incredible feats such as memorising 65 thousand digits of pi. If this is your very first experience of using Mind Palaces then I recommend exploring them more yourself.</p>

		<p>At the end of the adventure game there is a small game to test your memory of the items that you have found throughout the game. These items written in bold are entered into a box. If they are correct they will appear below in a collection of boxes. The style of this game is inspired by the web game <b>Google Feud</b> created by <a href="https://justinhook.com">Justin Hook</a>. Once you have completed this game and are looking for something to lose time on enjoy guessing the autocompletes from Google.</p>
