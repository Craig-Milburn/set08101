		<p>You push at this door and it begins to move. You grin to yourself as you feel a slight moment of hope. You shove again and again but as you do the more you push find that you there is less and less movement on the door. Suddenly the door stops. You try to pull it to give yourself more leverage but it is now held in place by its own frame. This exit was never really an exit. You will have to travel deeper into the house if you are to escape.‚Äù </p>
