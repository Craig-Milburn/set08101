		<p>You climb through the window, resting on the edge of the windowsill. You look back one last time before pushing off. Sadly your trousers get caught on an nail. This causes you to shift forward your body slams into the fencing. You are impaled. There is no way out of this now. As you gargle on your own blood from where you are stuck you see a pair of mens business shoes walk up to you. You hear the man sigh defeatedly. He places a business card on the ground in front of your eyes. “Thank you for playing.” He walks away as you slip from this world.</p>
