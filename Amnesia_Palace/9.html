		<p>This is a long room, there are vast windows along the side of the room. The windows have all been smashed and the glass is sturine on the ground. The windows are barred shut, there is no way out through them. You can only think that you are glad you hadnâ€™t woken on the ground in this room. The cold air causes you to shiver. You look out across the grounds, a waste land with nothing around but another building off to the side. You call out, hoping for help but there is no response. You try again but you begin to understand that nobody is coming to save you. You are in this on your own. A door at the end leads out into the barren rear garden.</p>
