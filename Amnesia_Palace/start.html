		<p>You wake up on the ground of a dimly lit room. As you move to stand up you breathe in the dust from the ground. Your head hurts and you have no memory of where you are or how you got there. The last you remember you we walking home after a late night at the office. You quickly check your pockets, damn everything you had is gone. Now on your feet you brush yourself down. Through the pounding is your head you have a strange feeling you are being watched. You might not know where you are or what brought you here but you know you need to get out.</p>
