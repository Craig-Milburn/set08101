		<p>A long breakfast bar that would have once gutted out from the wall into the kitchen now rests as a ramp to the wall. The area below it has crumbled over the year. At the bottom of it an old brass <i><b>kettle</b></i> rests, tarnished and forgotten. You canâ€™t help but sympathise with the kettle for a moment. The cabinets have no doors left on any of them and all the drawers seem to have been shatter across the floor. A door at other end of the kitchen brings a small amount of light.</p>
