		<p>This room looks almost pristine. Old, unused but pristine. There is no dust on the ground, there is no rubbish or trash on the ground. Like the scene had been set. On the floor rest against a wall is a <b>violin</b>, not an expert but it looks to be brand new. You pick it up, the bow sliding from the wall to the floor, it echoes through the room. You feel alone. At the other side of the room is an old wardrobe, sitting almost central to the at side. Nothing about this room feels random.</p>
