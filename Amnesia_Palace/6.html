		<p>Unlike the violin this wardrobe is old. Very old. It reaches from the ground high above your head. There are two broad doors to the wardrobe. You try to move it to see if has been placed over anything of use. It doesn’t budge, this thing is heavy. While doing so you hear something shift within. There’s a chance it could be something to help you out of the house you think. You pull open the doors and you hear a mechanism slip. The red light of a camera is the last thing you see as a spring loaded axe is buried into your chest. You fall to the ground. You cough your last breaths and die.</p>
