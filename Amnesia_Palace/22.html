		<p>You climb out of the window, sitting on the ledge. It seems a lot higher than it had from within the room. You look behind yourself one last time. If this is a way out you’re going to take it. You jump from the window. The bushes break the majority of your fall but your right ankle catches some of the impact. Sheering pain runs up your leg, it’s clearly broken. You are able to drag yourself to a nearby road where someone eventually stops to check on you. Later you give your statement to the police from your hospital bed. One of the officers are checking through your clothes as you recount your story. He pulls out a small card, you ask what it is, knowing you had nothing on you. He reads it out, “Thanks for playing.” </p>
		<p>Congratulations, ending 5 of 7.</p>
