		<p>Down a tight set of stairs you travel. The bare walls make the basement bleak, a prison sell would not be too dissimilar. The last step your foot slips as you lose balance falling to the ground. The <i><b>marble</b></i> that took you down rolls past your eyes. You moan as you regain your composure, looking pass the marble and seeing the small room before you. There is a window at the top of the wall to your right and a large, long furnace along the wall the left of it.</p>
