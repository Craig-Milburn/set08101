		<p>This bedroom is bright. The walls are painted a sickly yellow. There is a bed over to one side, you see there is a suitcase under the old frame. You pull it out noting that there is little to no dust on the floor. The room is oddly clean, oddly sterile. Tentatively you open the <b>suitcase</b>, inside there is only a single photo of yourself. Your body fills with fear. Whoever did this to you knew you well enough to take photos of you. You have to get out of here. The nearby window is open, wide.</p>
