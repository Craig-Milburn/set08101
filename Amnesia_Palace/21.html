		<p>The window is not barred. The window is intact and doesn’t seem to be locked. You try opening it. It seems to be stuck, swollen as usual. Trying harder you are able to get the window to shift open. Open enough for someone to climb through. You look down from the window, it’s a straight drop but there are a number of bushes under the window. </p>
