		<p>Climbing into the furnace it is a tight fit but you can move. You crawl deeper into the furnace. Just as your whole body is within the furnace you hear a juddering creek. The door has closed behind you. You call out to see if anyone will respond. You hear the furnace click into life. Gets next to your legs begin spewing flames at you. The pain is excruciating. What will you do?</p>
