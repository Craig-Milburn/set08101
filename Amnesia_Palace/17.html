		<p>The pain builds, you smell your own skin burning up under the intense heat. You push forward. The breeze from the outside draws you on. You scream in pain as the rising heat increases as you crawl up the shoot, smoke from your burning clothes escaping in front of you. Eyes stinging you don’t notice you are out of the shoot until you feel the rough dried dirt in your fingers. You roll onto your back and pass out from the pain. You wake several days later in a hospital. There is flowers to the side of you with a small card attached. You pick it out as the nurses and police start to come in. The card reads, “That was fun, we should play again.”</p>
