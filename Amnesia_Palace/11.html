		<p>Entering the bathroom you choke on the mould that fills the air. You cover your mouth and nose with your top so that you can breathe safely. Looking to the wall where the shower stands. What was once a grand shower, deep and with multiple heads now features a black growth. It expands from the heads down the walls towards the drain. A bright yellow <i><b>umbrella</b></i> sits not a mark of the mould on it. Spending any longer in this room will do you no benefit. You move on.</p>
